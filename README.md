boolean 


================


this keyword reference  to instance  member.

If instance member and local variable have same name then this can be used to identify instance method;

================================

Constructor
=========

Constructor can be used to pass parameters  while creating object.

Class must have atleast one constructor

if you have not defined any constructor then Default constructor will be written by compiler.

Constructor will have same name of class name without return type. 


====================

Access Specifier
====================

private : class only 
default( no specifed)  : Inside package only 
protected : Inside package  all class  
			outside package only in derived class 
public : In all class

      default :  This method will have default defnition written in interface which can be overridden .
      
      static :  This method of inteface will be defined in inteface  only and can not be 
      overriden by implementing class.
